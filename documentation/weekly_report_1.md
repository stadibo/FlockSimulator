# Week 1

## Happened this week

* Pondering on what problem solve
* Created project
* Version control setup
* Visual design and vaguely defined structure

Most of the used time this week was used thinking about another topic only to at the end of the week find a better one. Only decided on the structure and needed components, did not have time to code functionality. Structure is not too complicated so hopefully I don't need to change it much. 

## Problems

Took way too long to figure out what to make this about, spent unnecessary time thinking about an idea for image manipulation, which I scrapped.

## Next week

Making the basic gui and coding the logic for matrix operations. Ideally I have the objects moving according to the given vectors and maybe one behavior implemented.

## Time spent

* 4h researching image processing (which led me to the subject that I later chose)
* 2h setting up project
* 1h figuring out components and and design of simulator
