# Using the application

## Using the simulator

To run the simulator download or generate the _.jar_ file (intructions below) and either type ```java -jar DIR``` replacing DIR with the relative path to the location of the _.jar_ file, or by double clicking the _.jar_ file in a file explorer.

When launched the simulator will initially spawn 100 agents and will look like this:

New agents are created by holding the left mouse button and dragging the mouse inside the window. All agents can be removed by clicking the _clear_ button.

Values for the agents' behaviors can be adjusted by using the sliders. Alignment determines how much agents steer in the same direction as its surrounding agents, cohesion determines how much agents will stick together, and separation determines how much agents will repel other agents. MaxSpeed limits how far an agent can travel per frame. MaxForce determines how big of a force the agents can create to change thier direction.

## Benchmarking the application

Launching the application from the console with a command line argument "TEST_X" (X = label for test) will launch the benchmarking side of the program. The test consists of running the algorithm without the GUI trying various amounts of agents (25 - 3200) for 1000 position updates. The time for 1000 updates and the average time for each update is printed for each case. Multiple command line argument can be written and these will all be run as benchmarks.

Add these as individual arguments (TEST_X) when launching application):

Test label | Test case |
---------------- | --------- |
BRUTE | Brute force and handling distance without square root|
BIN | Bin-Lattice and handling distance without square root|
BRUTESQRT | Brute force and euclidean distance |
BINSQRT | Bin-Lattice and euclidean distance |

__Go to directory with the _.jar_ file. Type run command and benchmark arguments separated by spaces like so:__
```
java -jar FlockSimulator-1.0.jar TEST_BINSQRT TEST_BIN
```

## Command Line operations

### Testing

Tests are run with the command

```
mvn test
```

A test coverage report is generated by running the command

```
mvn jacoco:report
```

The coverage report can be viewed by opening the file _target/site/jacoco/index.html_ in a web-browser

### Checkstyle

The checks defined in the file [checkstyle.xml](https://github.com/stadibo/FlockSimulator/blob/master/FlockSimulator/checkstyle.xml) are run with the command

```
 mvn jxr:jxr checkstyle:checkstyle
```

Potential error messages are shown by opening the file _target/site/checkstyle.html_ in a web-browser

### Generating an executable jar

The command

```
mvn package
```

generates an executable file _.jar_ into the directory _target_

### JavaDoc

JavaDoc is generated with the command

```
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

JavaDoc can be viewed by opening the file _target/site/apidocs/index.html_ in a web-browser
