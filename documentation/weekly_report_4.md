# Week 4

## Happened this week

* Created ArrayList replacement
* More unit tests
* Planning optimization of algorithm with data structure

Did not get as much done this week as planned. Simple fixes and straightforward data structure ("ArrayList") created.

## Next week

Create optimized spatial data structure / algorithm for finding neighbors for agents. Make automatic benchmarking part of application.

## Time spent

* 3h Writing unit tests
* 2h researching optimization of nearest neighbor queries
* 2h Writing "ArrayList" data structure
* 2h Writing documentation
